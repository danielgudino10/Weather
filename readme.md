### Weather App
This is a simple weather app created by Daniel Gudino. It allows users to search for weather information for a specific location and displays the current weather and temperature.
## Technologies Used
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<li>JavaScript
### Badges
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

### Usage
Enter the location in the search input field.
Click the "Search" button.
The app will retrieve the weather information for the specified location and display it on the page.
The app also provides pre-defined weather information for several cities.

## How It Works
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specific location.
When the user clicks the "Search" button or selects a pre-defined city, the app makes an API call to retrieve the weather information.
The fetched data is then displayed on the page, including the temperature and weather description.
The app also stores the searched city in local storage for future reference.
